This file is a placeholder for the arena.png image that would be used in the PVP system's duel mode.

To create a simple arena image:
1. Create a PNG file with dimensions 800x600 pixels
2. Fill it with a dark blue background (#1a1a2e)
3. Add a grid pattern of light lines for reference
4. Add a border in purple (#9932CC)
5. Add text labeling it as "Duel Arena"

Alternatively, use the create-arena-images.html tool that generates this image.
